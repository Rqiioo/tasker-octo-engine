# Donate

If you find this project useful, you can consider donating by using one of the
channels listed below.

This is just a way of saying "thank you", it won't give you any benefits like
higher priority on issues or something similar.

## Open Collective

these options to donate:

subscription and cancel it once the donation was succeded.
